# Dungeons-and-Dragons
To Do:

Necessary:

Loop through local storage object and print names into the DOM ul

On click display the desc property of each spell

Prevent an undefined spell from being added to the local storage

Nice to have:

Display the data from a spell on search with a separate button to add to spell list

make the site look nicer, maybe like an old book?
